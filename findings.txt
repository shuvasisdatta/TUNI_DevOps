# Findings on What Containers Share with the Host

Docker Containers are basically lightweight distro that run on isolated environments and share operating system kernel. However, they do share certain resources and configurations with the host system:

1. **Kernel**: Docker Containers share the same OS kernel as the host. Docker containers are much more efficient than virtual machines that require separate operating systems.

2. **File System**: Docker containers can access the host’s file system using volumes or bind mounts. This lets them store data or share files between the container and the host.

3. **Networking**: Docker containers have isolated networking. They can share the host’s network interface.
